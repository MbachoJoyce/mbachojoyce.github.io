Hi! I’m a passionate software engineer based in Nairobi, 
            Kenya, with a deep love for solving problems and creating
            meaningful digital experiences. From a young age, I’ve been
             fascinated by technology and how it can transform the way we 
             live and interact with the world. This curiosity has driven me 
             to constantly learn and grow, earning me several personal certificates 
             in web development, app creation, and system design along the way.
        </p>  
        <p>
            I specialize in web, game, and mobile app development, combining creativity
            with technical expertise to build solutions that are not only functional but
            also user-friendly and fun to use. I enjoy taking complex challenges and breaking
            them down into elegant, intuitive designs. Whether it’s crafting a sleek website or
             developing an engaging app, my focus is always on delivering high-quality results 
            that solve real-world problems.           
        </p>   
        <p>
            When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or helping others
             with tech support. I believe in continuous learning and love keeping up with the
              latest trends in development. My drive to innovate is balanced by a personal 
              touch—I care deeply about the work I do and the impact it has on those who use it.            
        </p>   
        <p>
            In everything I do, I bring passion, creativity, and a desire to make things work better
             for people.
